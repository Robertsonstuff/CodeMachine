# CodeMachine
This is a simple code populator for my personal blog. This is the first idea I had to expand on creating a simple form but making it more personal in the event of saving myself some time. It very straight forward and doesn't require any external depenancies (pip installs). You'll just need to create a text file in the same file directory as your code and you may need to tweek a few stings to inside the save_info() and end_post() functions to suit your website html.
