# CodeMachine
This is a simple code populator for my personal blog. This is the first idea I had to expand on creating forms by making it more personal and saving myself time. It's very straight forward and doesn't require any external depenancies (pip installs). You'll just need to create a text file in the same file directory as your code and you may need to tweek a few stings to inside the 'save_info() and end_post() functions' to suit your website html. And Bob's your Uncle!! You have a form that produces all the boring code and you can get back to the important stuff, the content!
